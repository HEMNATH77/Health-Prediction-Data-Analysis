# Health-Prediction-Data-Analysis

# INTRODUCTION

<P> This project focuses on exploring and visualizing health-related datasets to uncover trends and predictive patterns in various medical conditions. Tableau, with its powerful data visualization capabilities, is used to create interactive dashboards and visual insights that help identify key health indicators and their relationship with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions.

This project aims to leverage Tableauâ€™s user-friendly interface to perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), allowing users to quickly gain insights from large health datasets. By integrating advanced filtering, interactive charts, and predictive analytics models, the project enables healthcare professionals and researchers to interpret complex health data with ease, empowering them to make data-driven decisions for better patient outcomes and preventive care.</P>
