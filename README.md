# Health-Prediction-Data-Analysis

# INTRODUCTION

<P> This project focuses on exploring and visualizing health-related datasets to uncover trends and predictive patterns in various medical conditions. Tableau, with its powerful data visualization capabilities, is used to create interactive dashboards and visual insights that help identify key health indicators and their relationship with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions.

This project aims to leverage Tableauâ€™s user-friendly interface to perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), allowing users to quickly gain insights from large health datasets. By integrating advanced filtering, interactive charts, and predictive analytics models, the project enables healthcare professionals and researchers to interpret complex health data with ease, empowering them to make data-driven decisions for better patient outcomes and preventive care.</P>

# DATA EXPLORATION
<p>In this dataset, we identified that health issues such as diabetes and heart disease play a significant role in the overall health of individuals. These diseases are detected based on several key factors, including age, BMI (Body Mass Index), hypertension, smoking history, HbA1c level (which indicates average blood sugar levels), and blood glucose level. These variables provide crucial indicators that help in detecting and predicting the likelihood of these conditions. In this project, our goal is to visualize the data related to these diseases, offering clear insights into how these factors contribute to the detection and prevalence of diabetes and heart disease. By doing so, we aim to support better understanding and decision-making in preventive healthcare</p>
